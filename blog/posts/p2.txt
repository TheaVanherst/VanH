        I’ve been playing a lot of Counter-Strike recently.
        I'm worried it's becoming a bit obsessive considering
        I’ve given myself the pleasure of sitting down and
        editing together what felt like a chaotic story of a
        regular competitive game of Counter Strike.

        I’m pretty happy with it, but it’s probably going
        be the last video I make in Sony Vegas. I’ve come
        to the realisation that in terms of actually editing
        and composing, it’s easier to smash clips together.
        However, when it  comes to <b>actual</b> editing, it
        becomes too much of a hassle. Anyway, I’ll probably
        get around to remastering it artLatch some point.
