    <p><b>Blender & Character Development.</b></p>
    <p>
        I've been SUPER busy this month; since my last post I basically
        have stopped the majority of the development on
        Vanh.art. And with good reason! I've been working,
        learning and developing in blender for the past
        20-ish days, and I've managed to conjure myself around
        200 hours in blender.
    </p><p>
        So, what have I been making? At first I just generally
        wanted to try and physically design petra in a way
        that I can actually envision her, as it's been almost
        2 years since I designed her. I still really don't
        have a great picture in my head on how I want her to...
        well, look. So this was mainly to try and give myself
        a bit of wiggle room to develop her with a few tools
        I usually don't have at my disposal.
    </p>
    <p><b>Developing Petra</b></p>
    <p>
        My general conclusion from all this is; <b>don't develop
        characters through modeling</b>. It's too time-consuming, by
        such an insane extent, just <i>really</i> don't try it.
        The main problem I've had twice now, is that you get far
        too far down the chain of the development process, and
        you've probably spent more than a few hours UV wrapping
        and completely finished the model itself. Only to want to
        change the design because the UV map and textures you've
        already started developing, and it needs completely restructuring for
        the changes you want to be taken place.

    </p><p>
        So yeah, the development process on trying to design petra
        really didn't go to far on both occasions. But the main
        conclusion to all this is that I know how to UV map, and
        develop models now. Which is far more than what I could say
        about my experience in college. It could be just, having
        Blender as my main tool of choice rather than Maya? I'm not
        entirely sure, but this time around felt way more intuitive
        as much as a cumbersome project it ended up being overall.
    </p><p>
        I ended up using a few low poly models that were pre-rigged
        and working around them to try and break down the methodologies
        for putting everything together and how the rigging in particular
        may affect the model if I ever get around to doing anything
        at a later date. It was mainly with the intent of future proofing.
    </p><p>
        Also, the benefit of using other people's models is that I
        can spend a lot of time learning how someone got to that result,
        rather than being thrown off struggling to make anything at all.
        I just personally find it easier to work with already existing
        content and purposefully having to work around it rather than
        struggling on the basic tooling like shapes. However, by the
        late part of development, I ended up tearing apart and scrapping
        a lot of the original model design from the knowledge I ended
        up getting.
    </p><p>
        I learned a lot and at this point was pretty confident with
        the experience that I'd had to be able to move on to doing
        some proper modeling with what I now know. The main of which
        being rendering, texturing, UV mapping and other necessities.
    </p><p>
        Now onto the nitty-gritty, The
        process I just described was mainly the first week or so
        of trying to get a grip of Blender in general. So of course
        knowing the development cycle and not really foreseeing a lot
        of the issues I didn't really go into detail on, that was
        the end goal regardless of my result with an end product.
        The means of this wasn't to get a result out of it, but rather
        having an ideal of petra in mind is a spire of motivation to
        learn on behalf of the results I wanted to get.
    </p>
    <p><b>Developing Coffee.</b></p>
    <p>
        With knowing that my vision on Petra was still a blurry mess,
        I ended up continuing to develop the model I already had in my
        hands, with a means to try and get it more detailed and
        proportional. The main shape is something I already had with
        petra's model and thought it would be a good start for a first
        time user of Blender.

            <div><figure><img src="/blog/img/p17d.png"></figure></div></div>
    <p>
        I don't know what to say about these two other than
        to nervously laugh. The model on the
        left is the model I ended up giving up on to develop
        petra with. The model on the right, being the same
        model as the one on the left, just about 50 hours later.
    </p><p>
        I'm really thrilled with how she turned out and the fact that
        this is my <b>third 3d model <i>ever</i></b> is a statement
        I couldn't be more proud to say and be 100% true. I probably
        went a bit too far in terms of the model resolution, but
        at that point I'm nitpicking; this is exactly how I wanted coffee to look.
    </p><p>
        The main difficulty with developing this model is trying
        to develop and design ways to make sharp corners and
        define body shapes such as the tonal difference between
        the stomach and hip; making the curves seem somewhat
        natural, but defined enough to be clearly differentiated
        between the two body parts. And of course, the thighs
        being one of the focal points when it comes to trying
        to refine edges properly because of the massive hassle
        of designing the eyes to be the way they are. I ended up
        having to do a lot of faffing about just to prevent
        issues with shading.

            <i>Left: showcase of body curve definition.<br>
               Right: close-up of defined sharp corners, specifically the eyes.</i>
    </p><p>
        These pictures specifically are pretty early in the
        development process, and ended up getting smoothed out
        and cleaned up a lot more when I ended up getting onto
        designing and developing shaders for her.
    </p><p>
        I think the process I found most fun, now that we're onto it,
        is shading. It's such a delightful way to send a few hours
        tweaking and mixing different combinations of colour processing.
        I can't exaggerate how much this pleases me and my photoshop needs.
    </p><p>
        I'm not sure if I'll end up keeping with this methodology of
        shading, as the way I'm currently getting the holographic-esc
        colour range is by using the shader to RGB plugin, which turns out,
        you can't use to do ray tracing with. Ray tracing is super inefficient. Go figure.
    </p><p>
        Quick rundown; Having ray traced lighting, translated
        into rgb values, just to translate it
        back to get the colour you want not only SOUNDS inefficient
        but is INSANELY inefficient in practical use cases. At some
        point I will end up having to find alternading shaders which
        toggle between the two depending on the usecase I want.
        But for all intents and purposes, I probably won't be using
        ray tracing anyway.

        <i>Shading methodology, and an edge shader showcase.</i>
    </p><p>
        As discussed previously, I <i>did</i> end up coming back
        to the matter of edges for shading purposes and cleaning
        up the wireframe. The original solution to my issues of
        lighting edge-bugs was to just duplicate the edge, and keep
        the edges as close as possible, so the shading would
        have to transition between nanometer sized faces, making
        the edge lighting close to invisible and / or unnoticeable.
    </p><p>
        The additional asterisk I ended adding to that, was another
        set of edges to ensure no edge-bugs; an additional face
        before the 90 degree curve, and another on the opposing side.
        It ended up giving a pretty good result and as good as I'm
        probably going to get. <i>The more you know</i>.

        Finally time to talk about the bit I've been avoiding talking
        about: I haven't finished the model yet. But I will.
        Progress on this has generally just haulted because
        I've realised that the long, unavoidable process of
        developing the head, or to be more specific, the hair.
    </p><p>
        It's a nightmare. Not because it's generally difficult to
        design, but just because my mind literally screams for me
        to do anything else and I keep avoiding it, developing
        other things, and coming back to it to realise the same issue.
        It's not that it's hard, it's just my ADHD hates the repetative
        process of designing hair-esc strands. I <i>did</i> have quite
        a bit of fun developing the 'pony-tail', and the layered
        look at the back of the hair to get the effect as such.
    </p><p>
        However, because of the head being way more detailed, especially front
        facing, it just ended up taking a bit too long and I've
        managed to distract myself onto other projects for long enough
        that I'm no longer motivated to work on this. ...for now. I will
        come back to it at some point in the near future. Pretty much everything
        is developed and ready to puppet rig and design clothes for her,
        so it's just the matter of forcing myself to sit down for long
        enough to design the fringe and optimising.

        <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p><p>
        I loved this project, and it's probably the most proud I've been
        about my experience with something. Maybe this all this is
        actually terrible, and the fact I only have 200 hours and
        super inexperienced has just resulted my perspective being
        screwed by the lack of experience? I don't know. But as I
        iterated earlier, for this being my 3rd 3D model ever, I'm
        incredibly proud of her, and she looks great.
    </p><p>
        I will come back to this, and considering I'm writing this
        in february to make up for my absence, it has <i>kinda</i>
        reinvigorated me to want to come back to this. We'll see.
    </p><p>
        Anyway, I've talked wayyy too much, and would love
        feedback on this experience. This was a great way to end my
        year and have the finish push for a new learning experience.
