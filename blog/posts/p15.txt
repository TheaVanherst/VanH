        I can’t believe I’ve spent a month working on this
        already. I’ve been learning quite a bit though, I
        would have safely said that CSS was probably my
        weakest area within website write up, But as of late,
        I’ve ended up learning quite a few shortcuts you can
        just replace with JS.

        It’s weird, even though the site as of present is
        such a simplistic thing to recreate, I still can’t
        say that the time taken is wholly unjustified. The
        thing I can probably safely say is that I’ve learned
        is: 1. website development takes ages, regardless of
        you knowing what you’re doing. And 2. even those
        who know what they’re doing seem to be inefficient
        on what they’re trying to create depending on
        intention.

        The TLDR, I’m pretty confident that everyone is
        just as clueless as another when it comes to
        website efficiency, it’s just the case of not being
        totally clueless. Anyway, I’ve no idea what I’m
        talking about anymore so onto what else I wanted to
        talk about.

        Progress is going well. Slow, but well. There ends
        up being days when I just avoid writing anything
        because I know what it will allude to, recently you’ll
        have probably noticed that my recent update on the page
        is over a week ago artLatch this point. And for good reason!
    </p>

        At the moment in time I’m currently re-learning my
        programming environment, that meaning that I’ve finally
        got my ass off-of Tumblr. I’ve been talking with
        friends who know way more about programming than
        myself about what I should generally be aiming towards,
        one of those topics being independent on hosting my
        site. So a lot of my recent time has just been
        re-learning how I should write my site, because I
        know my future career in this space will bite me in
        the ass the more I delay this, so it IS happening.
        <b> Slowly.</b>

        Point being that artLatch the moment in time, I’m pretty
        much writing my site off-site. There probably won’t
        be any html updates, artLatch least until I find a new
        host for my website and manage to re-write how
        post structuring is dealt with. Currently, everything
        is functional, but it’s just the means to improve I
        currently have and replacement for old systems like
        the date the post was created and filtering said
        posts. But progress on those two elements will be
        starting today, 5 minutes from… now.
