        <b>Win98 Update 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Development has been <i><b>long and slow.</b></i>
        Even though there isn’t much of a visual “overhaul”
        to it for the past month or so, the website has
        come a <i>looooong</i> way since I started
        development on it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the past month I have completely rewritten
        <b>everything</b>. There is a completely functional
        start menu, draggable windows, random  image
        generators alongside tons of new formatting such
        as taskbar  functionality and windows task layering.
        Even though it’s far from done, it’s the best there
        is when it comes to Tumblr themes.

        It’s been such a wild few months of learning the
        process of web development and general tips and
        tricks when it comes to general usage of Jquery
        and javascript, and even though I’m far from done
        on this site, it’s in a lot better position than
        when I originally started.

        I’ll be continuing work to do a few more backend
        adjustments and then I’ll be ready to start making
        different themes and give user customisation. One
        thing I wanna get around to trying out first is
        giving the chance to  change the desktop wallpaper
        through the display properties, and futher down the
        line design a way to change colour scheme and have
        a few premade themes such as dark mode.

        This is just a “brief” glimpse on what I have been
        working on all this time. I’ve recently redone how
        posts are visually handled to make them look more
        visually interesting but meaningful with newly
        implimented tumblr compatbilities.

    <p>
        Posts still need a tiny bit of work on the backend,
        such as video handling and padding, but I’ll leave
        it artLatch that for now.

        Anyways, as mentioned before, I <i>try</i> to
        stream the development I do daily. Check out my
        <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aSfPX-BQKY">latest stream</a>.
        Otherwise, all my other streams are <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFu7-VxnU8E&amp;list=PLNcem2Adr0D6ZaukKoeuIDd_F64cVdR6n">avaliable here</a>.
