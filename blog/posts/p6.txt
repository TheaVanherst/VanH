        <b>Win 98 Update 3</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        That’s right. More updates from the pit of hell
        called my coding. It’s now a month into 2021 and
        I’m still working on this thing. Tons of new
        things since the last update so I thought I’d give
        a quick few lists of progress I’ve made.

    <p>
        So the elephant in the room is the entirety of the
        Display Properties window with all of it’s glorious,
        glorious functionality. I’ve been working pretty
        hard having to redo most of the backend to get the
        thing to be fully functionable, but artLatch last, here
        it is.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ve fully added functioning schemes alongside
        previews of said scheme, wallpapers, colours and
        desktop icons. I’ll be adding more specific
        customisation artLatch a later date, but for the time
        being I’d rather keep it to the essentials while
        I work on other overhauls I need to progress on.

    <p>
        There’s a few premade schemes you can pick from
        and choose, and the code is really expandable as
        messy as it is. I literally haven’t touched HTML
        with JS prior to decemember so there’s probably
        100 better ways to do the same thing, but I’d
        rather just figure out as I go along and I’ve
        figured I really hate Jquery.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
        Schemes was the “big one” I’ve been trying hard
        to get out of the way for the past couple of weeks,
        so I’m just gonna do some quick fire features
        that have been added including a more in-depth
        idea on schemes that have been added;
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            I added tasks and tabbing between tasks only to
            replace it with dynamic tasks as of yesterday,
            and will adjust their position according to other
            windows that are opened and closed instead of
            being predetermined.
        </li>
        <li>
            A total of 7 schemes added, 5 themes including 2
            high contrast options, 16 desktop colour options
            and 10 wallpapers to choose from.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tons and tons of post formatting such as better
            video scaling and padding on images to be removed
            depending on the post type.
        </li>
        <li>
            Posts are minimizable and maximizable alongside
            formatting adjustments such as scrollbars alongside
            tons of formatting for patch notes, permalink posts
            and additional well needed backend stuff for the
            future.
        </li>
        <li>
            More efficent post handling and start menu handling.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        I have two additional windows also currently being
        worked on such as Time and Date and Windows Media
        Player, which revolves around youtube embedding for
        the sake of easy implimentation.

        I’ve been enjoying the process of writing HTML, but
        development has been taking a long time regardless
        of the 4-8 hours I invest daily in this thing. Who
        would have guessed website development took so long,
        huh?
    </p>
    <p>
        Regardless, I took the past couple of days to take a
        break and hopefully I can get around to developing
        more windows now that I basically redesigned the
        entire logistics of the entire taskbar for a second
        time.

        <strike>I still need to replace the infinite scroll
        script though.</strike>
