        <b>GENESIS</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I haven’t posted here in a few months, there’s a few
        reasons to do with university and a lot of reasons to
        do with currently being <b>more interested in drawing</b>
        and programming.

        GENESIS is one of my recent pet-projects to do with
        university. My end goal being an in-browser, 3d
        visualization including a very simplistic real-time 3D
        cross, based on the cover artwork for (arguable one of
        the best albums of all time) "GENESIS", from Justice.

        At the present moment, little progress has been made
        due to rendering complications and not being advised
        or educated well on the subject of <i>how</i> exactly
        the rendering engine works. But despite that, I've
        managed to get a few of the foundations prepped and ready.

        I have a few more projects in the works, but this is
        what I’ve been&nbsp; spending a bunch of my time on
        recently, if you want to see what i’m currently upto,
        I’ve been <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjMMf0WzUPo">streaming it on youtube.</a></b>

        Let it be said, <b>I've never worked on javascript
        prior to a couple of weeks ago</b>. I'm starting
        to only just learn the basics on javascript as a
        language at all and, personally, I think it's a pretty
        bad idea to push a design student such as myself, into
        a programming language that I've not only not had
        prior experiance in. Especially in the case of
        directing me into not only a spin-off of the language,
        but generally programming as a whole as a whole.

        Anyway, enough of me complaining. I’ll be posting a
        few more things I’ve been working on in the upcoming
        month.
