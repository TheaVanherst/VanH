    <p><b>Vher98 Update 5</b></p>
    <p>
        I know it’s only been a couple of weeks since the
        last blog post about my recent updates towards
        developing Vher98, but trust me it’s for a good
        reason, I’ll split it up into chapters to sorta
        give a bit more of an explanation towards
        developments and get a bit more in depth about it
        for once.
    </p>
    <p><b>Display properties.</b></p>
    <p>
        This has been delayed for SO long, and finally I’ve
        gotten around to doing it. Finishing the display
        properties menu. The display properties has been
        the bane of my existence about this website but yet
        my best feature, just from the schemes feature alone.
        But this week I have a new addition, and that is to
        say I now have desktop icon schemes! In-which, allows
        you to change the desktop icons based on preselected
        spritesheets (Which you can also change by the
        command prompt!).
    </p>
    <p>
        At the moment there are 6 presets which you can select,
        I recently did a massive sprite redesign for desktop
        icons based on my new character, Petra! But that’s
        for a future update, for now I’ve set the default
        spritesheet and included all of the old ones, which
        you can select from, alongside being able preview
        them at a smaller resolution to be compatible with
        the display properties window.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’ve also added a few other settings which you can
        see previews of, not all of which are programmed yet,
        so at a future date I’ll either change them around or
        program them. But for now, I’ve added the ability to
        change desktop icon sizes to a more native modern
        scale, but leaving the default setting as the classic
        windows 98 recreation.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ve also added additional wallpapers, only accessible
        through the effects tab and “CSGO MODE” which was
        featured in the background of the preview blog post,
        which recreates the settings for my counterstrike
        main menu, along with adjusting the desktop icons and
        wallpaper to fit.
    </p>

    <p>
        As previewed above, designed to be a slight nod to my
        recent “Neon Genesis Evanjollion” video, featured on
        my youtube channel. I’ve recorded and animated my
        counterstrike character with loopable animations which
        play continuously in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, I know this is a lot of text for what seemingly
        is a minor update, but the main reason I was able to
        design the latest additions to the effects tab was
        because of the recent massive rewrite I’ve had to do in
        order to fix a bunch of problems I was coming across,
        one of which being how unoptimised themes were
        relatively.
    </p>
    <div class="row">
        <div><figure><img src="/blog/img/p8c.png"></figure></div>
        <div><figure><img src="/blog/img/p8d.png"></figure></div>
    </div>
    <p>
        <i>Left: new code which include schemes selection and the new effects menu toggles.<br>
           Right: old code, only including schemes selection.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        This entire re-write revolves around basically storing
        arrays of data rather than manually switching values
        of variables, along with tons of adjustments to
        unneeded variables and how theme data is required to
        be stored, as CSMODE needs to store the theme data to
        be able to toggle from the data needed to switch from
        the current scheme to CSGO mode.
    </p>
    <p>
        I cannot understate howmuch of a rewrite this is, and
        as much as I would like to say “I really don’t get why
        I ever did it otherwise”, I would be lying. But this is
        a super incredable optimisation and looking at this
        comparritively makes me super pleased with how far i’ve
        come from knowing nothing about HTML/JS to this. Jquery
        is a godsend.
    </p>
    <p><b>Start Menu</b></p>
    <p>
        On my newly found optimisation craze, I’ve also done
        tons of rewriting to the startmenu, another long overdue
        reform. Even though I’ve recently done a rewrite on this
        thing, I knew there was still tons of improvements with
        my new knowledge of jquery.
    </p>

        <i>Top image: old code in Javascript<br>
           Bottom image: new code in Jquery</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ve also put aside a few hours of time to dedicate
        creating new assets for the start menu. It became
        REALLY hard to find a nice and consistent style which
        windows 98 used, but it was really hard to find sources
        of any of the original assets but also have the levels
        of details I knew windows 98 for, especially when tons
        of the assets from windows 98 came from windows 95,
        which still relied on 8 bit colour in some instances.
    </p>
    <p>
        So I did a bunch of digging and found the assets Windows
        98 used at the end of it’s lifespan and modified them a
        bunch to put into Vher98, giving my own personal touch
        and hopefully to keep the art direction of icons a bit
        more consistant and unique to look at and use.
    </p>
    <p><b>Task management</b></p>
    <p>
        Alright, last big one. Task management. Another long
        overdue reform was needed for this thing. Prior to this
        month, tasks relied on whatever manual order I decide
        to create the task and assign a number to, the number
        will dedicate placement on the taskbar depending on
        which value was the highest.
    </p>
    <p>
        So for example, the Display Properties will ALWAYS be
        the third task on the taskbar if you was to open
        everything up, simply because I didn’t know how to
        calculate the placement prior to designing tons of
        assets. Especially when the original conception of the
        site RELIED on myself manually creating the visual
        look of the taskbar as the entire site was designed
        based on images. From windows, taskbar to the
        start menu. It was awfully inefficient.

           Bottom image: The new optimised and redesigned code for calculating taskbar placement and task assignment.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyway, that being said I now have automated calculation
        for taskbar task placement. <b><i>If you open a task,
        it will open and remain in the order of the task being
        ordered. </i></b>Writing this makes me have a smug
        little grin on my face just from how happy I am I was
        even able to get this to work properly, and it’s only
        a few lines of math to even get the result I have.
    </p>
    <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
    <p>
        There’s tons of other stuff I wish to go on about, but
        that’s why I have patch-notes. if you wish to read them,
        you can check them out on my Github, or in the Start menu
        of Vher98.

        There’s a few bugs I need to get around to fixing,
        but I’ve invested a few hundred hours into this
        thing over the past month alone, and I really should
        take a break to get onto other projects I wish to
        get around to completing.
    </p>
    <p>
        I recently started developing a mod for Terraria
        and some drawings I want to get around to finishing
        sooner or later. But, the most important thing I
        REALLY need to get around to is branding. Over the
        past month or two I’ve been growing more and more
        displeased with how I present myself and the fact I
        have stagnated a bit within the realms of my career
        and I need to get around to sorting these personal
        matters sooner rather than later.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ll be back with a couple of projects. It might take
        a while but I promise it’s for a good cause.
