    <p><b>Vanh.art Progression [Again]</b></p>
    <p>
        It's been another two months, and here I am
        again complaining about how long it's been
        since the previous update. That's right, sit
        tight; it's website development update time,
        and it's going to be a long one.
    </p><p>
        I've always wondered why the "One Page Design!"
        thing caught on as hard as it did, and it's
        because website design takes a lot of man hours
        otherwise JUST to compensate for mobile. And mobile
        being such a major slice of the market, I can
        now see why it's such a hassle to develop for.
        The one big thing that I've learned through
        the process of developing this site for the past
        couple of months is that It was such a mistake
        on my part to design the site with the premise
        of page containers in mind.
    </p><p>
        Mobile has been a thorn in my side until
        recently, and even then it's still problematic
        due to not having any proper means of scaling
        fonts or upscaling the site.
        And though I can see the reasoning for the way
        mobile deals with website; oh boy do I absolutely
        hate dealing with slight issues like document
        sizing and the search bar in chrome!
        I couldn't have ever imagined the search bar even
        being a thought in my mind, never-mind a problem
        <i>at all</i> when I started this mess. And though I
        have come up with solutions, I feel like they're
        really half-baked but for the time being, I'm just
        going to have to live with what I've been given.
    </p><p>
        My conclusion to this rambling is;
        developing the website the way it is, was and
        is, a mistake. I find it astounding how much
        I've learned this year in terms of web
        development and feel like I look at websites
        with a completely different lens to how I did
        12 months ago. It's bizzare to even think
        I wrote Vher98 the way I did, and I'm much
        better off for it.
    </p><p>
        That being said, let's list the great new
        features I've added!
    </p><p>
        <b>0.75</b> : As of yesterday, I rolled out an update
        that adds to the animation page, now known as
        'Video & Media'. This page includes a large
        selection of my streams and major content
        pieces and include as much variation I could
        have possibly added. This is, after all, a
        site designed and developed on the process of
        myself learning and trying to show off the
        capability I have as an artist.

    <p>
        <i>Back-end code & Front-end preview of the new 'Media' page.</i>
    </p><p>
        This update also includes a replacement of all
        tacked on Iframe players on the site, and now
        redirects to the video and Media page. This
        solution is what I hope is the most optimal
        way to deal with being able to show my media
        based content without spamming media players
        everywhere. And the way I've designed the
        back-end not only makes it easier for
        managing the site & content, but should also
        decrease page loading and increase page
        performance as a result.
    </p><p>
        Like everything else on the site, it's way
        over-engineered and is really easy to swap
        out and add content. It's pretty much in
        it's finished state, but I wish to at least
        polish it up and make it look less amateur
        at a later date.
    </p><p>
        And final notes on this update, I've
        re-designed how content is loaded on page-load
        and how extra content is added after the fact.
        Aka. how content is managed and handled and
        when or how it should load in, rather than
        doing it all at once. The page now just
        loads everything you have the possibility
        of seeing, which is mainly just the content
        on the front pages. But that is something
        I'll also need to optimise at a later date.
    </p><p>
        I also added some code that allows me to
        detect between clicking and holding the mouse down!
        It might seem like a trivial affair, but
        it's a bit of a hassle to nail down the combination
        of events required to make the page feel seamless
        alongside it not causing too many errors.
        Anyway, this fixes a few errors when page
        dragging due to  requiring cursor events to
        switch between none and active otherwise
        page dragging doesn't work properly, while
        sustaining a maintainable ability to click
        on things like videos and links without it
        not responding.

        <b>0.70</b> : Released last month, this update
        was entirely focused on the archive page, which now includes
        a clearer and easier way to understand and
        view the content that I've managed to create
        over the past 7 years. The page is sorted from
        newest to oldest and is designed for those
        who don't follow my content who want to see a
        timeline of my art and how my art has become
        the way it has without needing to read the
        entire development process. (that's what the
        blogs are for!).
    </p><p>
        After a lot of contemplation, I've realised
        the necessity of effectively highlighting
        my art in such a way where I can fit as much
        content in as little room as possible, without
        belittling the content itself. This page is
        not longer just a tumblr page where I post my
        art. I have the urge to at least document the
        process of what I'm doing to explain and
        prove that I do infact, know what I'm talking
        about and I am learning from what I'm doing.
        (It's good for employment, I promise) That
        being said, I still need somewhere to output my
        art in mass doves, for whenever I do decide
        to focus back on mass content creation. That's
        why I welcome; the archive page.

    <p>
        <b>0.65</b> : I realised quite a while ago
        that the state the backend was with how I
        categorised what CSS did what and where it should
        be was a disaster. The entire site has basically had
        a rewrite in a few elements such as completely
        redoing the CSS. It was long overdue, but it's
        done. Here's my piece of advice that anyone
        who's dealt with css would probably sigh at;
        Don't categorise your types of CSS for elements.
        (Eg; Colour, animation, pos, etc.) It's a bad
        idea, don't do it.
    </p><p>
        And as mentioned prior, mobile <i>was</i> a thorn
        in my side, and that was because I didn't really
        understand how to deal with touch. I didn't really
        take into consideration that there's a massive
        difference between touchscreen devices and mobile.
        And after a bunch of testing, I did realise a
        few solutions to my problems, the page is now
        designed with 3 different states in mind,
        depending on touch capabilities, and desktop
        capabilities and adding or removing features
        depending on which. It seems to be working, and
        a lot of it is focused on math so I'll move
        onto my next point.

    <p><b>Dev Thoughts</b></p>
    <p>
        Developing this site has basically been my full time job.
        This entire process of developing myself a
        cleaner and easy to add to website has been
        such a hassle. I REALLY didn't expect it to
        take even nearly as long. However, I have
        once again learned tons! Here's a piece of
        advice from myself; <i><b>Do not make this site.</b></i>
    </p><p>
        And I mean that. As much as I love this site in
        a way that it shows my technical know-how of
        mathematics and ability to solve problems to
        issues I have during development, this entire
        projected was flawed from the start if I ever
        wanted to design a system compatible with
        mobile.
    </p><p>
        I wish I could talk more about all the different
        problems I've come across these past two months,
        but this post would be 5 times longer to even
        scratch the surface. I've loved the past two months
        of work on this site, but I really hope
        that I can finish this thing off for new years.
        (It won't! But I can dream.)
    </p><p>
        I've managed to get myself a job recently, so
        a lot of my spare time will soon be dedicated to that...
        so I should get a few other projects out of the way
        in the meantime. If you want follow those kinds
        of projects, you can find it on my
