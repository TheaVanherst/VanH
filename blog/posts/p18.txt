    <p>
        I've been really busy with work recently, even though
        I've been working a lot on my Terraria workshop as of late,
        it's hard to find motivation. I have a few reasons, but one
        of which being the current low numbers in players and
        active engagements on the workshop. I won't get into
        my own personal quarrels with the workshop popularity system,
        it's mainly just something that's amounting to me feeling a
        tad bit of burn out.
    </p><p>
        My main quarrel right now is that what
        I really want to get done requires a lot of reparative tasks and
        similar, if not that, then the result of having to develop
        the same animation cycles as that's just what generally works best.
        It's a lot to do with wanting to go in an alternate direction
        with art direction, and Terraria hinders a lot of that in essence.
    </p><p>
        That being said, my main priority now is probably to work on
        other projects. At some point I <i>do</i> want to work on
        a game of sorts. But as of now, I'm just generally improving
        and working on personal projects.

        <i>Youtube & Twitter Banner / Vanh.art Social Media Banner</i>
    </p><p>
        I've had a couple of banners floating around that I've mainly
        been using off and on depending on my mood, some of which
        has ended up getting me to rethink how I've dealt with dark-mode
        on my site. I've really been wanting to push them to the website
        front end without sacraficing quality for a while now, so
        now I'm just back onto working to my website after looking at
        some of my CSS / Jquery back-end and wanting to fix a few irks I
        have.
    </p><p>
        Progress overall has been well, I pushed out an update a couple
        of days ago that completely rehauls the colour scheme and how
        the banner is dealt with in the CSS, now the banner & profile
        image isn't just a preset element in the root, but stored in the
        colour scheme array now too.
    </p><p>
        It's not much of a change, but it just helps changing elements out
        a bit quicker in the future. Also at least it's easier to understand
        that everything gets loaded to the front all at the same time rather
        than half being mounted in the CSS, half in Jq.

        <i>Left: New dark-mode colour scheme; Right: Old dark-mode colour scheme.</i>
    </p><p>
        The site is designed with light-mode in mind, dark-mode was
        VERY much an after-thought just for additional accessibility. I
        felt at the time it was fine as is, but after stewing on it for
        a while, it was treated unfairly and just a colour-offset
        to make the accents match with a dark gray doesn't do much justice
        to what I want the website to be. Now that the dark-mode scheme has
        intentionally picked colours and everything assists the over-engineered,
        over-designed, over-thought feel of the site I want.
    </p><p>
        I've been doing a few other tweaks I'm still in the progress of
        developing, such as the recently added side-nav tooltips and the
        long, <b>LONG</b> awaited image viewer. I've been pushing this
        feature back for such a long time as I know the result of adding
        such a feature will force my hand to engineer a thumb-nail system.
        One thing at a time, Thea. One thing at a time.

            <div><figure><img src="/blog/img/p18e.png"></figure></div>

    <p>
        <i>Left: Artchive Image Viewer; Right: Dev-blog Image Viewer.</i>
    </p><p>
        It was such a hassle to sort this out to be as adaptable as it is
        and understand what format is suitable to different sets of images.
        This feature works exactly as expected (thanks to hours upon hours
        of tweaking and re-writing the same lumps of code), you click on an
        image and will fade out everything else on the page. As with
        everything else on the site, it's stupidly over-engineered and not
        efficient at all because I have a very specific look in mind. The
        solution I have at the moment in time 'works', but ideally speaking
        I really want to clean this up a bit.
    </p><p>
        I've also been adding some of the back-log I've been meaning to
        add to the 'Artchive'. Such as, Terraria sprite work, banner work,
        videos, and I managed to get time to clean out the old iframe system
        in blog posts to redirect to the 'Video & Media' page. There's tons
        of small nicks and nacks besides the afore mentioned, but a lot of it
        is tweaks to the back-end that is currently in the process of a
        're-write'. And by that I mean, >optimising.
    </p><p>
        <b><i>God, I'm ecstatic about the new colours!!!!</i></b>
    </p><p>
        I really wanted to put my enthusiasm to be working on the
        site again out there and the new vibes the site has going for it!
        I feel like my branding is starting to feel more like a purposeful
        aesthetic choice rather than whatever I have leftover from the end
        of that week, I love it and I hope you do too!
