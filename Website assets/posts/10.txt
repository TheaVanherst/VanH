<li class="comment "><p><b>Another lunge into Terraria Mod Development.</b></p><p>I’ve been meaning to post this for the past few weeks but I’ve just never managed to get around to it, but I’m getting pretty close to finishing a major overhaul so I’m just gonna start posting the deets.</p><p>For the past month I’ve been working on a Third Impact resource pack for Terraria, inspired by Evangelion Neon Genesis. I don’t know how I got onto this topic to be honest, a month ago I wanted to make a new spritesheet for my website, now i’m developing an entire resource pack.</p><figure class="tmblr-full"><a class="post_media_photo_anchor" data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/3d22d2e89040d37d69fe62e70c442f3b/48a9fc2a99d4782c-e5/s1280x1920/acc8625399e6def0985aefbec86f607b5dbd945b.png" data-big-photo-height="804" data-big-photo-width="973"><img class="post_media_photo image" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/3d22d2e89040d37d69fe62e70c442f3b/48a9fc2a99d4782c-e5/s500x750/e4ccdfa9787972031293e576a247d2e72eb40cf6.png" alt="image"></a></figure><p>I haven’t formally announced the pack previously, simply because I think there’s a lot more potential for general design exploration, even if it was just a graphical rehaul. </p><p>So that’s what I’ve been upto for the past week, because I genuinelly felt like there was a lot of room to improve in an area AND artstyle I’ve never really touched prioviously. </p><div class="npf_row"><div class="npf_col"><figure class="tmblr-full"><a class="post_media_photo_anchor" data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/42660fa1fa51f17f7adb1a7c8f659fe5/48a9fc2a99d4782c-70/s1280x1920/de4616a9d9d033f8acccba1af98db79583584946.png" data-big-photo-height="841" data-big-photo-width="936"><img class="post_media_photo image" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/42660fa1fa51f17f7adb1a7c8f659fe5/48a9fc2a99d4782c-70/s500x750/91f9e0a28624db206aa69c03f9a4501506206ff4.png" alt="image"></a></figure></div><div class="npf_col"><figure class="tmblr-full"><a class="post_media_photo_anchor" data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/db56a814be64366bef63db12617dd71a/48a9fc2a99d4782c-f7/s1280x1920/e13481eb5cd152b1d75ec287b9740e7296925440.png" data-big-photo-height="841" data-big-photo-width="936"><img class="post_media_photo image" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/db56a814be64366bef63db12617dd71a/48a9fc2a99d4782c-f7/s500x750/e5414c4ffa57400e023552a46539020163b9ef2d.png" alt="image"></a></figure></div></div><p>Personally, I’m still not 100% pleased with it when it comes to the hands are. But the current differences between the original conception and the current state is a<b> HUGE</b> fucking improvement, and I’m super happy with how it’s come out.</p><p>I’m gonna get around to it but there’s a lot to work on and think about due to technical limitations with terraria and how little I have to work with due to ((resource pack)). </p><p>Either way,<a href="https://href.li/?https://twitter.com/TheaVanherst/status/1390888310025990149/photo/1"> It’s been a long development process</a> of learning general shading styles and improving working at such a small scale, and since the original conception of the idea it’s in a much better state than it was as of a week ago.</p><figure class="tmblr-full"><a class="post_media_photo_anchor" data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/afbc276e3309ef2898ca39894f8ddc32/48a9fc2a99d4782c-23/s1280x1920/4b909c62b6a7ff6c1ca49f3baa86a6253765017a.gifv" data-big-photo-height="338" data-big-photo-width="600"><img class="post_media_photo image" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/afbc276e3309ef2898ca39894f8ddc32/48a9fc2a99d4782c-23/s500x750/724a58ee5fd4c8ab4128162a4efe0db9a08afdf3.gifv" alt="image"></a></figure><p>Here’s a small little render PRIOR to the latest graphic upgrades I’ve managed to do, and set aside bias and such, I still think it’s a nice option to play with, even without the technical limitations of a resource pack.</p><p>And people seem to really enjoy the recent content I’ve been producing since the original release, and with over <b>10000 current subscriptions</b> to the mod, it’s probably one of the biggest projects I’ve been to town on.</p><p>There’s a <i>LOT</i> of assets I’ve been working on simultaniously, and even though most assets are barely 50x50 pixels, to conceptually make it seem consistant with the show is a difficult feat.</p><p>I ended up taking a 1-2 week break on developing animation cycles for a bunch of NPC related mods, in order to try and refresh my mind and just generally take a break from working on the same scheme of assets. Inwhich, I’ll probably talk about at a future date and / or post.</p><div class="npf-link-block has-poster"><a target="_blank" href="https://href.li/?https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2449497541"><div class="poster" style="background-image:url(https://64.media.tumblr.com/2ab45becf8076a2ab917b865daaadded/48a9fc2a99d4782c-ef/s540x810/9e0dd9a1f131a7fffe76a910802ca2e9da2a5dd9.jpg)"><div class="title">Steam Workshop::Moonlord Replaced with the Third Impact 0.59v [ MUSIC UPDATE ]</div></div><div class="bottom"><div class="site-name">
