<li class="comment "><p><b>Win98 Update 1</b></p><p>It’s close to the end of 2020 and I’m two weeks into working on my blog, <a href="https://vher98.tumblr.com/">vher98.tumblr.com</a>. Not much has <i>visually</i> changed, but there’s been tons of work that I’ve been doing that you won’t see unless you see the back end in comparrision.</p><p>I  knew website development took a long time, but I never really knew it  would take <i>this long</i> for such simple features. The majority of the time invested into the site as of late is a more functional start menu, the code upto now is really jank, but I’m pretty confident being able to set up a basic interface and trimming down the fat in the next few days is probably the best way to go.</p><p>I know it’ll be way incredibly better for a more effective learning process for myself, alongside remembering a bit more of how to lay things out the way it should be.</p><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full"><iframe id="embed-613d00c20a605001326653" class="embed_iframe" src="https://safe.txmblr.com/svc/embed/inline/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dm8DMSVHuA-I#embed-613d00c20a605001326653-partied" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="500" height="280" frameborder="0"></iframe></figure><p>It’s been a fun personal project I’ve been working on and streaming. If you want to come check out my slow and unentertaining progress, then come and join my stream. I’ve been trying to stream everyday but most of my streams either get  taken down or youtube just… doesn’t function the way it intends to.</p><p>Anyway, a lot of what i’m doing is a learning procress with a slow and steady learning curve. (I’ll get there eventually…)</p><p>See you in a few weeks.</p></li>
