A lot of the “Win98″ theme I was using was either completely jank or  having issues. I did try to polish it up and do adjustments to the HTML  to make images wrap properly, but regardless of my work, the theme is  generally flawed and underdeveloped so over the past week i’ve just  decided to redo it.</p><p>Even though it’s the similar kinds of design and vibes, <i>trust me</i>,  it’s a completely different backend from the ground up in both the CSS  and HTML department. It’s basically a complete rewrite. Although I am  using a basic html sheet for things such as animated buttons or  simplistic title bars, there’s still <i>so</i> much work I’ve had to do to make both the theme AND Tumblr behave properly.</p><p>Either  way, the progression on the overhall is going SUPER well and the time  investment has been very worthwhile, so I’m sharing it here.</p><p>If you want to check out the current progress on the site, <b><a href="https://thealonic.tumblr.com/">check it here</a></b></p></li>
