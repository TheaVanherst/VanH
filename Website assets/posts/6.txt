<li class="comment "><p><b>Win98 Update 2</b></p><p>Development has been <i><b>long and slow.</b></i> Even though there isn’t much of a visual “overhaul” to it for the past month or so, the website has come a <i>looooong</i> way since I started development on it.</p><p>Over the past month I have completely rewritten <b>everything</b>.  There is a completely functional start menu, draggable windows, random  image generators alongside tons of new formatting such as taskbar  functionality and windows task layering. Even though it’s far from done,  it’s the best there is when it comes to Tumblr themes.</p><div class="npf_row"><div class="npf_col"><figure class="tmblr-full"><a class="post_media_photo_anchor" data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/1e68b1fa9475b632f474b00a12d010b3/207acc6f5517cf64-f7/s1280x1920/6b8a4dc986f7a4ee010818818778aafb2f76cb4a.png" data-big-photo-height="496" data-big-photo-width="754"><img class="post_media_photo image" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/1e68b1fa9475b632f474b00a12d010b3/207acc6f5517cf64-f7/s500x750/ddf94c685a9cd860d68e04a6db112461a3d5409d.png" alt="image"></a></figure></div><div class="npf_col"><figure class="tmblr-full"><a class="post_media_photo_anchor" data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/1bb39ae7e9d8909f4890f27603e79599/207acc6f5517cf64-de/s1280x1920/85bcc951631b808b45f8001bdc2272a345c5af4f.png" data-big-photo-height="654" data-big-photo-width="729"><img class="post_media_photo image" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/1bb39ae7e9d8909f4890f27603e79599/207acc6f5517cf64-de/s500x750/24d2a7b8d8dd9b8f8751da50462c5b4c27217ba0.png" alt="image"></a></figure></div></div><p>It’s been such a wild few months of learning the process of web development and general tips and tricks when it comes to general usage of Jquery and javascript, and even though I’m far from done on this site, it’s in a lot better position than when I originally started.</p><p>I’ll be continuing work to do a few more backend adjustments and then I’ll  be ready to start making different themes and give user customisation.  One thing I wanna get around to trying out first is giving the chance to  change the desktop wallpaper through the display properties, and futher down the line design a way to change colour scheme and have a few  premade themes such as dark mode.</p><p>This is just a “brief” glimpse  on what I have been working on all this time. I’ve recently redone how  posts are visually handled to make them look more visually interesting but meaningful with newly implimented tumblr compatbilities.</p><figure class="tmblr-full"><a class="post_media_photo_anchor" data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/132014dad4fe0d8ae1efbcbb212fd490/207acc6f5517cf64-47/s1280x1920/3795e2c24edb2176e68fa7940744cd05fdfc3aaa.png" data-big-photo-height="158" data-big-photo-width="540"><img class="post_media_photo image" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/132014dad4fe0d8ae1efbcbb212fd490/207acc6f5517cf64-47/s500x750/cbe371ed652eb04bcb9d85c4a768eb4ad6fe443f.png" alt="image"></a></figure><p>Posts still need a tiny bit of work on the backend, such as video handling and padding, but I’ll leave it at that for now.</p><p>Anyways, as mentioned before, I <i>try</i> to stream the development I do daily.
