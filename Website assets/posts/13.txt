<li class="comment "><p><b>Petra</b></p><p>Another week has been and gone, and I think it’s a funny how rebanding is usually more most active I ever get in terms of production. </p><p>Another thing I’ve been brewing on for the past couple months is trying to develop both myself and my own characters through drawing in my spare time. And after working on a few drawings across the past couple months, it’s taken me this long to realise that I’m not an artist. </p><p>It’s really bizare to me that it’s taken me this long to realise after the past couple of years of enjoying drawing, and stewing on the idea of not being able to put on the paper EXACTLY what I want. Even saying that, ironically enough, I’ve never considered myself an artist in the first place. I never considered myself as one is more of a pretentious sense of not wanting to identify as something I’m not, which once again is ironically, something I never realised I was even doing.</p><p>That being said, I <i>do</i> think I’m particulary good at concept development, and for the past year or so I’ve been developing a new character that I think envisions my internal personality struggle, or something that at least envisions me as my artistic merit, rather than said personality struggle with a hint of anxiety.</p><div class="npf_row"><div class="npf_col"><figure class="tmblr-full"><a class="post_media_photo_anchor" data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ca59230875d64f63af9220127db26ed8/c282dad949ff9c27-07/s1280x1920/52470de47b98006e30e4322bc303a3370b183862.png" data-big-photo-height="" data-big-photo-width=""><img class="post_media_photo image" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ca59230875d64f63af9220127db26ed8/c282dad949ff9c27-07/s250x400/170d7d91e2aeb9a5d2c78016a6f3fc1c65102250.png" alt="image"></a></figure></div><div class="npf_col"><figure class="tmblr-full"><a class="post_media_photo_anchor" data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/8e46943a68d6eace47f29a01cbe6050c/c282dad949ff9c27-13/s1280x1920/396f3f47e43e6b8238161e022748fac03c3333c1.png" data-big-photo-height="564" data-big-photo-width="428"><img class="post_media_photo image" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/8e46943a68d6eace47f29a01cbe6050c/c282dad949ff9c27-13/s500x750/c7ba07209c7580f675df5b8507ea58473b8a28ed.png" alt="image"></a></figure></div></div><p><i>Left: Original concept art of Petra, designed by me mid 2020. <br>Right: A Commissioned piece of Petra, drawn by Sinnerpen mid 2021.</i></p><p>Here’s Petra, a messy amalgamation of concept art created by myself and from now on will be the design I use to try and encapsulate myself as an artist, and finally envisioned in a manor I’m pretty happy with. </p><p>She’s been a pretty simple design I envisioned as of a year or so ago, but with internal conflictions as which I wanted to do with myself, both as an artist and a person, I really didn’t know what to do with her. I think my main struggle revolved around thinking that myself was the end all and be all of which I wanted to envision something to be, and then never being happy with it. When in reality I think I just needed someone else to capsulate inwhich I want to envision, as I don’t think I will ever be happy with the drawings I create and share. </p><p>And how else to do that but get someone capable with doing a better job than I could?</p><p>That being said, I did some additional work after the fact to see how I could incorperate her into my branding moreso than just a profile picture, because I really do admire the drawing Sinnerpen managed to do for her.</p><figure class="tmblr-full"><a class="post_media_photo_anchor" data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/76cf1a5919b73e11552f40cccc15556a/c282dad949ff9c27-29/s1280x1920/e5b0e4458a4470ab65530a24b8bba48848c6e885.png" data-big-photo-height="576" data-big-photo-width="2480"><img class="post_media_photo image" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/76cf1a5919b73e11552f40cccc15556a/c282dad949ff9c27-29/s500x750/8a036773ddebcf27543f88116acead12999bc9c5.png" alt="image"></a></figure><p>And here we have it! A final result of a week of work and a month of mental torment. Especially with the logo having to specifically be designed around the new design elements I ended up giving to Petra as of late. But hopefully, you can agree that it’s all been connected together in a nice little bow apposed to my previous set of branding.</p><p>I would have posted this earlier but I had to do a few adjustments to adapt this for all platforms I’m currently active on, usually I have a few issues with this due to something like the logo not working or looking as effective as possible due to the resolution given for a social media banner. But I have to say, for once I have to say I have no problems, which really is a first.</p><figure class="tmblr-full"><a class="post_media_photo_anchor" data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/463a8ddf3e3c8aa667c647fb25f99a82/c282dad949ff9c27-85/s1280x1920/b926622c2127142eae0139dde57d704a366d4fb5.png" data-big-photo-height="388" data-big-photo-width="1267"><img class="post_media_photo image" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/463a8ddf3e3c8aa667c647fb25f99a82/c282dad949ff9c27-85/s500x750/1ba6585c2a1232af11c6e558761b7ada0b13cbc7.png" alt="image"></a></figure><p>This logo adaption is long overdue and the lesson being that I think I’ll stick to concept art and development rather than trying to earn the artist tag which I know i damn well don’t deserve.</p><p>Looking back it’s really bizzare to me all these issues with trying to point a finger at something and identify as it, I just never was able to see the hypocracy of trying to be something that I said I was never claiming to be. It’s hard to put into words. Especially as someone not very good at formulating a sentence which relies on the muddled mess of mental amnesia of how I try and label myself and my personality. </p><p>It’s a weird bunch of emotions I’m feeling right now, but hopefully in the long term I’ll be a much better person for it. Either way, I hope you enjoy the design elements I’ve managed to produce out of this and I really hope you like Petra.</p></li>
