<li class="comment "><p><b>Polishing Touches</b></p><p>I’ve managed to get around to cleaning up and vectorising my logo as of late, which is good news for future projects and to flex my ability to do some clean looking graphics for once in my life. It’s not as perfect as it could be in terms of mastering consistancy in thickness of text, border thickness and general connotation of shapes and angles… but it’s at a much better position than it was. </p><p>I had to do a bit of cleanup and polish a lot of the angles that was originally in the design and fix some intent I originally had during the design conception, but don’t think I did an <i>entirely</i> effective job at. One of which being the horns on the logo being a representation of the design elements of Petra, and I think the quick mock-up I designed really struggles to give the intended shape and the outlines just don’t do justice to the shape of the logo itself.</p><p>Regardless, here’s the final design, with all of it’s slight imperfections:</p><figure class="tmblr-full"><a class="post_media_photo_anchor" data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2f987b62eea77699449125f6f9f310db/fef707cd085d9573-b1/s1280x1920/df6481b4755ea7fc6716319300d0f19bd39d4b16.png" data-big-photo-height="1681" data-big-photo-width="3220"><img class="post_media_photo image" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2f987b62eea77699449125f6f9f310db/fef707cd085d9573-b1/s500x750/0244547921d03dcfb046324a2342ef609293b3b0.png" alt="image"></a></figure><figure class="tmblr-full"><a class="post_media_photo_anchor" data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/230ae0fda3cd6d58d085cf267981b39a/fef707cd085d9573-01/s1280x1920/90d142a3a9ec65edc97c75cf9d5484ea7f825291.png" data-big-photo-height="433" data-big-photo-width="823"><img class="post_media_photo image" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/230ae0fda3cd6d58d085cf267981b39a/fef707cd085d9573-01/s500x750/85a82bbde5c80fff10db04f5c4e7554825bcf26d.png" alt="image"></a></figure><p>Top image: Newly vectorised logo<br>Bottom image: Original logo design with an additional outerglow.</p><p>As an extra sidenote, I also designed the new vector with and without an outline. The older, original design has a default black glow with tons of manual tweating in order to get the same general shape, but it’s really lazy looking and doesn’t pertray the shape that it’s supposed to. </p><p>…Alongside, of course, additional tweaks to the colour pallet that the logo is displayed as. Not to mention a different outline hue to contrast the new base purple a bit better.</p><p>Regardless of my little quibbles of slight design imperfections, elements as simple as consistant line thickness and the 16,000 x 8,000 of glory is a much more glamorous result than the original concept piece and I’ll be soon to get around to swapping any current usage of my logo out with this. The vast increase in quality is such an eye opener I couldn’t <i>not</i> do it.</p><figure class="tmblr-full"><a class="post_media_photo_anchor" data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2257febddae1439b4b2791fe68e50a11/fef707cd085d9573-34/s1280x1920/f32cf338afe536ed4eb14a0dae12df7dc277ee2f.png" data-big-photo-height="417" data-big-photo-width="786"><img class="post_media_photo image" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2257febddae1439b4b2791fe68e50a11/fef707cd085d9573-34/s500x750/4c1a9eada162690b659a8d0e824c82a0afbdfda0.png" alt="image"></a></figure><p>(And an additional benefit of getting around to vectorising and having a finalised product is the ability to convert it for other usages that work effectively individually!)</p></li>
