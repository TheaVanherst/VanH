<p>Hello, and welcome to my hopefully last major post of my current branding transitional period! It’s going pretty well, but I feel like the only thing I’ve been doing for the past couple months here is talking about myself. Hopefully I’ll find a new project to work on sooner, rather than later, but regardless-</p><p>I’ve been currently working on a long overdue update to my blog, as it’s <b>THE</b> thing that presents all my art and my time investment. It’s been sorely under presented for a year or two now and I’ve been meaning to get around to finding a new theme, but to no avail, as a result I’ve been making my own!</p>

<p>At the moment in time, I’ve very bare bones and holds most of the tumblr elements I want featured, but it’s taking a while to test out ideas I have in mind and <b><i>will take some time. </i></b></p><p>I recently finished developing my page scaling, which is definately a new thing for me, but only is designed to accustom to anything between 500px and ((ideally)) 1920px wide. It’s mainly because I don’t really have any solutions in order to figure out a good screen ratio for things such as tablets, so ideally I’ll try to design with the general 16:9 ratio with what I have in mind.</p>
<p>I’ve been slowly developing a page-esc kinda concept to treat the website like a bunch of pages to display my work on without enforcing page redirects, because they are inheritly awful. The goal being that the idea will come across somewhat artistically progressive alongside with having good compatibility for tablets. This process is also a pretty good excuse to re-establish my CSS skills because lord knows Vher98 has a lack of them.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b>;  I’m definately busy.</p>
