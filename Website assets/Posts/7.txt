That’s right. More updates from the pit of hell called my coding. It’s now a month into 2021 and I’m still working on this thing. Tons of new things since the last update so I thought I’d give a quick few lists of progress I’ve made.<br></p><figure data-orig-width="1901" data-orig-height="942" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/b64137b2889f559f10e313133268abfc/7b314f2b86add015-b3/s500x750/b8892d3e7c05779570ffafd9d76a4cc55b1e3b19.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1901" data-orig-height="942" width="500" height="248"></figure><p>So the elephant in the room is the entirety of the Display Properties window with all of it’s glorious, glorious functionality. I’ve been working pretty hard having to redo most of the backend to get the thing to be fully functionable, but at last, here it is. <br></p><p>I’ve fully added functioning schemes alongside previews of said scheme, wallpapers, colours and desktop icons. I’ll be adding more specific customisation at a later date, but for the time being I’d rather keep it to the essentials while I work on other overhauls I need to progress on.</p><figure data-orig-width="723" data-orig-height="781" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/bfa8c4e95df366d59ebb5b24c3275d57/7b314f2b86add015-a8/s500x750/e3c2527ed40d2ed90c3afe86f2f1eb793f08e2e6.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="723" data-orig-height="781" width="500" height="540"></figure><p>There’s a few premade schemes you can pick from and choose, and the code is really expandable as messy as it is. I literally haven’t touched HTML with JS prior to decemember so there’s probably 100 better ways to do the same thing, but I’d rather just figure out as I go along and I’ve figured I really hate Jquery.&nbsp;</p><p>Schemes was the “big one” I’ve been trying hard to get out of the way for the past couple of weeks, so I’m just gonna do some quick fire features that have been added including a more indepth idea on schemes that have been added;<br></p><ol><li>
I added tasks and tabbing between tasks only to replace it with dynamic tasks as of yesterday, and will adjust their position according to other windows that are opened and closed instead of being predetermined.</li><li>A total of 7 schemes added, 5 themes including 2 high contrast options, 
16 desktop colour options and 10 wallpapers to choose from.<br></li><li>Tons and tons of post formatting such as better video scaling and padding on images to be removed depending on the post type.</li><li>Posts are minimizable and maximizable alongside formatting adjustments such as scrollbars alongside tons of formatting for patch notes, permalink posts and additional well needed backend stuff for the future.</li><li>More efficent post handling and start menu handling.<br></li></ol><p>I have two additional windows also currently being worked on such as Time and Date and Windows Media Player, which revolves around youtube embedding for the sake of easy implimentation.<br></p><figure data-orig-width="896" data-orig-height="639" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/66f0e73093808fba9dac78c7aa9033b6/7b314f2b86add015-7a/s500x750/23212c112b19b32ead7a655c19716202a0cdd8e3.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="896" data-orig-height="639" width="500" height="357"></figure><p>I’ve been enjoying the process of writing HTML, but development has been taking a long time regardless of the 4-8 hours I invest daily in this thing. Who would have guessed website development took so long, huh? <br></p><p>Regardless, I took the past couple of days to take a break and hopefully I can get around to developing more windows now that I basically redesigned the entire logistics of the entire taskbar for a second time.</p><p><strike>I still need to replace the infinate scroll script though.</strike><br></p></li>
