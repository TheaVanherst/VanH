        Another week has been and gone, and I think it’s a funny
        how re-banding is a period of most activity that ever comes
        from me in terms of production.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another thing I’ve been brewing
        on for the past couple months is trying to develop both
        myself and my own characters through drawing in my spare
        time. And after working on a few drawings across the past
        couple months, it’s taken me this long to realise that I’m
        not an artist.
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s really bizarre to me that it’s taken me this long to
        realise after the past couple of years of enjoying drawing,
        and stewing on the idea of not being able to put on the paper
        EXACTLY what I want. Even saying that, ironically enough,
        I’ve never considered myself an artist in the first place.
        I never considered myself as one is more of a pretentious
        sense of not wanting to identify as something I’m not, which
        once again is ironically, something I never realised I was
        even doing.
    </p>
    <p>
        That being said, I <i>do</i> think I’m particularly good at
        concept development, and for the past year or so I’ve been
        developing a new character that I think envisions my internal
        personality struggle, or something that at least envisions me
        as my artistic merit, rather than said personality struggle
        with a hint of anxiety.

        <i>Left: Original concept art of Petra, designed by me mid 2020.<br>
           Right: A Commissioned piece of Petra, drawn by Sinnerpen mid 2021.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Here’s Petra, a messy amalgamation of concept art created
        by myself and from now on will be the design I use in order to try
        and encapsulate myself as an artist; finally envisioned
        in a manor I’m pretty happy with.
    </p>
    <p>
        She’s been a pretty simple design I envisioned as of a year
        or so ago, but with internal confliction as which what I wanted
        to do with myself. Both as an artist and a person, I really
        didn’t know what to do with her. I think my main struggle
        revolved around thinking that myself was the end all and be
        all of which I wanted to envision something to be, and then
        never being happy with it. When in reality I think I just
        needed someone else to encapsulate in-which I want to envision,
        as I don’t think I will ever be happy with the drawings I
        create and share.
    </p>
    <p>
        And how else to do that but get someone capable with doing a
        better job than I could?</p><p>That being said, I did some
        additional work after the fact to see how I could incorporate
        her into my branding more-so than just a profile picture,
        because I really do admire the drawing Sinnerpen managed to
        do for her.

        And here we have it! A final result of a week of work and a
        month of mental torment. Especially with the logo having to
        specifically be designed around the new design elements I
        ended up giving to Petra as of late. But hopefully, you can
        agree that it’s all been connected together in a nice little
        bow apposed to my previous set of branding.

        I would have posted this earlier, though I had to do a few
        adjustments to adapt this for all platforms I’m currently
        active on, usually I have a few issues with this due to
        something like the logo not working or looking as effective
        as possible due to the resolution given for a social media
        banner. But I have to say, for once I have to say I have no
        problems, which really is a first.

        This logo adaption is long overdue and the lesson being that
        I think I’ll stick to concept art and development rather than
        trying to earn the artist tag which I know i damn well don’t
        deserve.
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking back it’s really bizarre to me all these issues with
        trying to point a finger at something and identify as it, I
        just never was able to see the hypocrisy of trying to be
        something that I said I was never claiming to be. It’s hard
        to put into words. Especially as someone not very good at
        formulating a sentence which relies on the muddled mess of
        mental amnesia of how I try and label myself and my
        personality.
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s a weird bunch of emotions I’m feeling right now, but
        hopefully in the long term I’ll be a much better person for
        it. Either way, I hope you enjoy the design elements I’ve
        managed to produce out of this. I really hope you like her.
