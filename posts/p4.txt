        It’s close to the end of 2020 and I’m two weeks
        into working on my blog, <a href="https://vher98.tumblr.com/">vher98.tumblr.com</a>.
        Not much has <i>visually</i> changed, but there’s
        been tons of work that I’ve been doing that you won’t
        see unless you see the back end in comparison.

        I  knew website development took a long time, but
        I never really knew it  would take <i>this long</i>
        for such simple features. The majority of the time
        invested into the site as of late is a more
        functional start menu, the code upto now is really
        jank, but I’m pretty confident being able to set up
        a basic interface and trimming down the fat in the
        next few days is probably the best way to go.

        I know it’ll be way incredibly better for a more
        effective learning process for myself, alongside
        remembering a bit more of how to lay things out the
        way it should be.

        It’s been a fun personal project I’ve been working
        on and streaming. If you want to come check out my
        slow and (not at all) entertaining progress, then come and join
        my stream. I’ve been trying to stream every day but
        most of my streams either get taken down or YouTube
        just… doesn’t function the way it intends to.

        Anyway, a lot of what I’m doing is a learning
        process with a slow and steady learning curve. (I’ll
        get there eventually…)

        See you in a few weeks.
