        <b>Identification.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ve been busy as of late with life problems of all things.
        One of which is trying to manage personal life transitions
        towards <i>actual</i> work, not forgetting my MtF transitioning.
    </p>
    <p>
        A constant requirement for the sake of my mental health is
        always giving some form of personal evolution of art and a
        constant cycling of self identification. And as someone who
        works a lot of art, I usually use said art to display it.
        If you’re an avid follower of my art, you’ve probably realised
        that it’s what I’ve been doing for years. Even moreso over the
        past couple weeks. The long awaited reconciliation on personal
        goals, morals and self identification. That being said, as
        described before, one of the things I’ve been developing is
        once again another step towards my personal branding and self
        imaging.

        To be honest, it’s been a huge problem for a while now. I think
        the “VeryVhersty” tag i’ve been going under a while was cute,
        but I think with the slow evolution of myself turning into both
        a female and a more and more semi-competent adult, or at least
        looking more like I know what on earth I’m talking about on behalf
        of my designing career. It’s more of a feeling that I actually
        need to start proving myself a bit more now that I want to focus
        on it from a career perspective a bit more, and taking the extra
        few steps to do and to prove myself to be able to do said tasks.
        Especially considering my current logo is just Bebas with a bit
        of gradient trickery done in AE.

        Here’s my initial concept art for something I wanted to create
        with some ideas I had alongside some character development
        stuff I must get around to writing about. But that’s another
        post for another time, lets continue with the topic at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think this initial design is really bad, unclear and awful.
        The idea is there but the design is too enlongaged, tall and
        the focus of the actual fontwork is SO off-center it really
        drags down the concept I had in mind. After producing this,
        I really did feel awful about it. Not conisdering mental stuff
        I was going through trying to give validation to myself of
        considering myself a designer in the first place, but generally
        as someone who isn’t sure what on earth their place is in life.
    </p>
    <p>
        The original concept was meant to be based on my full name,
        that being Vanherst. However, the spacing and alignment of the
        typography ended up being all over the place, so I cut it back
        to what the majority of the name sound is. Van-her-ss-t.
        Additionally, the tail at the end of the logo really didn’t
        help with the issue I was having trouble with in the first
        place, the spacing it was using.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other than that, the idea for the VA was pretty much what I had
        in mind, but the N is unclear to read and the H is unclear to
        what it’s meant to signify and represent. The flow between
        lines isn’t clear and the overall design doesn’t feel smooth
        and blend into eachother the way it should.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
        And after 3 more days of tweaking and coming back to it, here
        is what I ended up coming up with. I ended up getting a bit of
        style insperation from Ye Ol’ english, I think the H shows that
        off a lot. I have a few means to incorperate it into my branding
        a bit while still having that modern feel I want to try and
        chase after.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m still not THAT happy with it, but it’s mainly determining to
        myself if it’s actually effective or not, so I essentially just
        have to sit on it and see if I still like it without the after-haze
        of creating this.
    </p>
    <p>
        From what I can say from a design standpoint, a lot of my previous
        logos I’ve usually had issues with don’t really apply, so i’m
        finding it really hard to judge it’s more objective effectiveness
        based on relative lessons learned. And that’s simply because they
        always end up seeming so simplistic and flat looking. God, am I
        sick of straight lines. I think it’s more of a evolution on the
        idea of most of the things I’ve been studying and learning about
        from design to politics to computers have always been a complicated
        issue and that’s what I probably get my personal interest of it
        from. Life is always a bit more complicated but maintaining
        simplistic to an overwealming degree, and I want my next step in
        life to display that.
    </p>
    <p>
        This design kinda reminds me of my Rainpro.Dash logo, which prior
        to this, was probably my personal favourate design I’ve managed
        to make. As much of a parody piece it may seem, it’s pretty
        effective at what I think it’s trying to accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
        Either way, I really feel this is a step up from my regular work,
        at least from a creativity standpoint specifically compared to
        older logo designs I’ve created in the past. All there is to
        contemplate now is a banner design towards this new found phrase
        of my life.
