    <p><b>Re-introdicing Win98.</b></p>
    <p>
        Christ, 2 months since the last development update
        here.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alright! I’ve made tons of progress over the course
        of the past 3 months, from some sleepless nights
        working on this damn thing to random spurratic
        development updates. So, I’m just gonna list a few
        big ones.
    </p>
    <p><b>Rebranding</b></p>
    <p>
        One of the major ones to me personally - I’m
        renaming the project from Win98 to Vher98.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have ideas for the project and after some general
        realisation on how long this project may take if
        I was to entirely recreate Windows 98. I think a
        better way to go about the project is to turn the
        project into something more practical for my own
        personal uses and to add my own “ease of access”
        features that Windows 98 didn’t originally have.
    </p>
    <p>
        This doesn’t really change the project at all, but
        it’s a bit of piece and mind for myself.
    </p>
    <p><b>Finalised Embedded Media Player!</b></p>
    <p>
        One of the earlier updates since the last update
        was the media player having some massive overhauls,
        with the addition to the interface, URL bar and
        general logic and visual overhaul. There’s even
        a fullscreen mode! Cute!
    </p>

    <p>
        I’m glad this was on my bucket list because I
        feel like this was the nail in the coffin for my
        struggles with javascript after developing this
        and being so heavily js focused. There’s a lot of
        ease of use features and accessability options
        included that needs to be done. So hopefully,
        you’ll enjoy it as much as I do.
    </p>
    <p>
        (There’s also tons of fun playlists and features
        in the start menu and command prompt.)
    </p>
    <p><b>Command Prompt!</b></p>
    <p>
        Speaking of command prompt, I added a command
        prompt! It’s been a while since I’ve properly
        updated it and I’ve realised a few problems with
        some OG commands I managed to develop, but most
        small feature set still work fine.
    </p>
    <figure><img src="/posts/img/p7b.png"></figure>
    <p>
        The main point is for debug information such as
        current status of animation sequences or current
        active tasks on the taskbar. But one of the
        functionality peices I have right now is to be a
        placeholder is being able to enforce custom
        varables or spritesheets! Which will hopefully be
        expanded apon within the next few days.
    </p>
    <p><b>Taskbar Overhaul!</b></p>
    <p>
        A small little addition I did is taskbar logic!
        No longer the days of static tasks, welcome to
        law and order! (Yes, I added open order)
    </p>
    <figure><img src="/posts/img/p7c.png"></figure>
    <p>
        I’m yet to add task draggability to be able to
        change the positioning of where it is on the
        taskbar, but other than that, that is the jist
        of it. A lot of math later and tons of backend
        well needed adjustments and optimisations.
    </p>
    <p><b>Ending notes;</b></p>
    <p>
        Regardless, there’s been tons of update. Too many
        to list. So if you’re enthusiastic about updates
        and developments I’m working on I’ve added
        patchnotes inwhich you can read and get updated
        live on what i’m working on. (Another feature
        I’ve managed to add within the past couple months)
    </p>

    <p>
        Anyway, thanks for reading, I’m gonna go back to
        developing html, hopefully add the addition of
        custom desktop sprites. Laters!
