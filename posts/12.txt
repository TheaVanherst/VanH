    <p>
        This week I’ve been working on branding more! Specifically,
        considering how I should approach my overall branding and
        how I show myself on social media.
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s been a tough one, it took a long time for me to be
        happy with my new logo simply due to <i>how many </i>god
        damn iterations it took to actually get it to the point
        in-which I’m the most happy with. However, I think a lot of the issues
        I was conflicted with was mainly what to do with it. And it’s
        hard to convey the kinds of recent conflict I’ve been having
        with myself without having paragraph apon paragraph explaining
        step by step of the breakdown inwhich I got to that point
        mentally.
    </p>
    <p>
        The conclusion to that point being with the new logo, I was
        conflicted with how I should, or if I should reinvent myself
        as a designer.

        Here’s a banner I made during the development of my recent logo,
        you’ll probably notice some differences between this and the
        final iteration, simply because it was exactly that. A banner
        in-which is a muddled mess of colours and lack of self-control
        and understanding. I was not really entirely sure on what to do
        with it, if I should use it, if it was good.
    </p>
    <p>
        The past couple days I’ve felt mentally broken, and it’s all
        because I wasn’t happy with a result like this. It wasn’t me,
        and my idea on reinventing myself as the designer I should be
        felt broken and shattered. Looking back at it now, I feel like
        the banner isn’t inherently bad, but the spacing and general
        focus of the banner is unclear. Putting it simply, it just isn’t
        clear on what it says, it’s just plain hard to read and
        understand what it’s trying to display. Not only as a brand,
        but as a personality.
    </p>
    <p>Overall, it just generally wasn’t what I wanted. Even something
        as simple as the main colours I should use throughout my branding
        I wasn’t really sure about. Regardless, I left it for a couple of
        days and kept coming back to the drawing board.
    </p>

        First of all, I tried to actually focus on the log itself, focusing
        specifically on colour, and this is my result. The colours are vibrant
        but not too contrasting. It’s really subtle and even the gradient
        sloping I think ended up coming out brilliantly. It’s such a sharp
        and sudden curve at the halfway mark and transitions upwards to the
        gray so naturally in a pixelated tessellated-like look thanks to the
        checker-board like style of the polka dots. The smooth, none linear
        feel of it I think really added to the shape of the logo. It feels
        dominating without actually having bright, purposefully bombastic
        colours or design elements. I really dig it.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an experiment of effectiveness and to test if it was even possible
        to add something like this effectively into a muddle of wide and vastly
        different colours, I readjusted my current banner with new assets and
        drawings, cleaned up a few design elements and got rid of a few old pieces.

        After all of this I’m feeling better of myself as a “designer”,
        and after my latest synopsis on myself as an artist, even more-so
        now that I feel like I’m actually achieving a bit more with myself
        as an artist. I’m happy with myself for the first time in a while.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apologies once again for the long post. I feel like the best way
        I can prove my mental process is to explain myself a lot, and
        Tumblr / blogging about my designs is probably the best way I can
        go about it effectively, and hopefully anyone who actually bothers
        to read it gets enjoyment out of the extra depth I’m passionate
        about.
