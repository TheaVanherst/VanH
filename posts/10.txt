        <b>Another lunge into Terraria Mod Development.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ve been meaning to post this for the past few weeks,
        I just never managed to get around to it. My main focus
        right now is getting trying to get this major overhaul
        cleaned up and finished, but I can't wait any longer to
        talk about it, so I’m just gonna start posting the deets.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the past month I’ve been working on a Third Impact
        resource pack for Terraria, inspired by Evangelion Neon
        Genesis. I don’t know how I got onto this topic to be honest,
        a month ago I wanted to make a new spritesheet for my website,
        now i’m developing an entire resource pack.
    </p>

        I haven’t formally announced the pack previously, simply
        because I think there’s a lot more potential for general design
        exploration, even if it was just a graphical re-haul.
    </p>
    <p>
        So that’s what I’ve been upto for the past week, because I
        genuinely felt like there was a lot of room to improve in an
        area AND art style I’ve never really touched previously.

        Personally, I’m still not 100% pleased with it when it comes
        to the hands are. But the current differences between the
        original conception and the current state is a<b> HUGE</b>
        fucking improvement, and I’m super happy with how it’s come
        out.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m gonna get around to it but there’s a lot to work on and
        think about due to technical limitations with terraria and how
        little I have to work with due to ((resource pack)).
    </p>
    <p>
        Either way,<a href="https://href.li/?https://twitter.com/TheaVanherst/status/1390888310025990149/photo/1"> It’s been a long development process</a>
        of learning general shading styles and improving working at
        such a small scale, and since the original conception of the
        idea it’s in a much better state than it was as of a week ago.

        Here’s a small little render PRIOR to the latest graphic
        upgrades I’ve managed to do, and set aside bias and such, I
        still think it’s a nice option to play with, even without the
        technical limitations of a resource pack.</p><p>And people
        seem to really enjoy the recent content I’ve been producing
        since the original release, and with over <b>10000 current
        subscriptions</b> to the mod, it’s probably one of the biggest
        projects I’ve been to town on.
    </p>
    <p>
        There’s a <i>LOT</i> of assets I’ve been working on
        simultaneously, and even though most assets are barely 50x50
        pixels, to conceptually make it seem consistent with the show
        is a difficult feat.
    </p>
    <p>
        I ended up taking a 1-2 week break on developing animation
        cycles for a bunch of NPC related mods, in order to try and
        refresh my mind and just generally take a break from working
        on the same scheme of assets. In-which, I’ll probably talk
        about at a future date and / or post.

        Anyway, just a small update for what I’ve been upto for the
         month or so. I haven’t posted anything yet, but I’m gonna
         post another couple pieces about the website and other
         terraria related items. So stay tuned for that.
