        <b>Introducing Win98</b>

        Well, it’s coming close to the end of the year and
        it’s time to show off some recent personal projects
        i’ve been doing.

        I’ve recently been having some problems with my
        sideblog, <a href="https://thealonic.tumblr.com/">Thealonic</a>.
        A lot of the “Win98″ theme I was using was either
        completely jank or  having issues. I did try to
        polish it up and do adjustments to the HTML  to
        make images wrap properly, but regardless of my
        work, the theme is  generally flawed and
        underdeveloped so over the past week i’ve just
        decided to redo it.

        Even though it’s the similar kinds of design and
        vibes, <i>trust me</i>, it’s a completely different
        backend from the ground up in both the CSS and
        HTML department. It’s basically a complete rewrite.
        Although I am  using a basic html sheet for things
        such as animated buttons or  simplistic title bars,
        there’s still <i>so</i> much work I’ve had to do
        to make both the theme AND Tumblr behave properly.
    </p>

        Either  way, the progression on the overhall is
        going SUPER well and the time  investment has been
        very worthwhile, so I’m sharing it here.
