<li class="comment "><p><b>Re-introdicing Win98.</b></p><p>Christ, 2 months since the last development update here. </p><p>Alright! I’ve made tons of progress over the course of the past 3 months, from some sleepless nights working on this damn thing to random spurratic development updates. So, I’m just gonna list a few big ones.</p><p><b>Rebranding</b></p><p>One of the major ones to me personally - I’m renaming the project from Win98 to Vher98. </p><p>I have ideas for the project and after some general realisation on how long this project may take if I was to entirely recreate Windows 98. I think a better way to go about the project is to turn the project into something more practical for my own personal uses and to add my own “ease of access” features that Windows 98 didn’t originally have. </p><p>This doesn’t really change the project at all, but it’s a bit of piece and mind for myself.</p><p><b>Finalised Embedded Media Player!</b></p><p>One of the earlier updates since the last update was the media player having some massive overhauls, with the addition to the interface, URL bar and general logic and visual overhaul. There’s even a fullscreen mode! Cute!</p><figure class="tmblr-full"><a class="post_media_photo_anchor" data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/5a830808aa7754d6e638f814e4018a24/93daaf4d3c073631-71/s1280x1920/e2811789b87309129efa35e5903eb44d186f4d71.png" data-big-photo-height="742" data-big-photo-width="1583"><img class="post_media_photo image" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/5a830808aa7754d6e638f814e4018a24/93daaf4d3c073631-71/s500x750/192b58c19bc3c2f8656e210fbbf95f79fa8e312e.png" alt="image"></a></figure><p>I’m glad this was on my bucket list because I feel like this was the nail in the coffin for my struggles with javascript after developing this and being so heavily js focused. There’s a lot of ease of use features and accessability options included that needs to be done. So hopefully, you’ll enjoy it as much as I do.</p><p>(There’s also tons of fun playlists and features in the start menu and command prompt.)</p><p><b>Command Prompt!</b></p><p>Speaking of command prompt, I added a command prompt! It’s been a while since I’ve properly updated it and I’ve realised a few problems with some OG commands I managed to develop, but most small feature set still work fine.</p><figure class="tmblr-full"><a class="post_media_photo_anchor" data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/8fd5e675cae30f3b48930be21a713424/93daaf4d3c073631-eb/s1280x1920/7c6b653d2f5daac1f49d2cdca9446d2ea253a855.png" data-big-photo-height="326" data-big-photo-width="687"><img class="post_media_photo image" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/8fd5e675cae30f3b48930be21a713424/93daaf4d3c073631-eb/s500x750/0230125d8e1992e6f764cd850533c324bcc4cf44.png" alt="image"></a></figure><p>The main point is for debug information such as current status of animation sequences or current active tasks on the taskbar. But one of the functionality peices I have right now is to be a placeholder is being able to enforce custom varables or spritesheets! Which will hopefully be expanded apon within the next few days.</p><p><b>Taskbar Overhaul!</b></p><p>A small little addition I did is taskbar logic! No longer the days of static tasks, welcome to law and order! (Yes, I added open order)</p><figure class="tmblr-full"><a class="post_media_photo_anchor" data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/1ab770101f0f80aa1ca1ac090e9d0d33/93daaf4d3c073631-47/s1280x1920/30fc311a2884f07654a28e919aafd39615aaa31d.png" data-big-photo-height="35" data-big-photo-width="994"><img class="post_media_photo image" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/1ab770101f0f80aa1ca1ac090e9d0d33/93daaf4d3c073631-47/s500x750/bcf5670280cf3632de04704733657dacadfdfc25.png" alt="image"></a></figure><p>I’m yet to add task draggability to be able to change the positioning of where it is on the taskbar, but other than that, that is the jist of it. A lot of math later and tons of backend well needed adjustments and optimisations.</p><p><b>Ending notes;</b></p><p>Regardless, there’s been tons of update. Too many to list. So if you’re enthusiastic about updates and developments I’m working on I’ve added patchnotes inwhich you can read and get updated live on what i’m working on. (Another feature I’ve managed to add within the past couple months)</p><figure class="tmblr-full"><a class="post_media_photo_anchor" data-big-photo="https://64.media.tumblr.com/cfc93cf7967aecce157ac5153aadeadc/93daaf4d3c073631-e6/s1280x1920/82a4db998d8180d4c8368699417152734bfcd3e0.png" data-big-photo-height="943" data-big-photo-width="832"><img class="post_media_photo image" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/cfc93cf7967aecce157ac5153aadeadc/93daaf4d3c073631-e6/s500x750/5fa10df749735b17ee4dbe9eba50e92daf83b121.png" alt="image"></a></figure><p>Anyway, thanks for reading, I’m gonna go back to developing html, hopefully add the addition of custom desktop sprites. Laters!</p></li>
