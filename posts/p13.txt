    <p><b>Polishing Touches</b></p>
    <p>
        I’ve managed to get around to cleaning up and vectoring
        my logo as of late, which is good news for future projects
        and to flex my ability to do some clean looking graphics
        for once in my life. It’s not as perfect as it could be in
        terms of mastering consistency in thickness of text, border
        thickness and general connotation of shapes and angles…
        but it’s at a much better position than it was.
    </p>
    <p>
        I had to do a bit of cleanup and polish a lot of the angles
        that was originally in the design and fix some intent I
        originally had during the design conception, but don’t
        think I did an <i>entirely</i> effective job at. One of
        which being the horns on the logo being a representation
        of the design elements of Petra, and I think the quick
        mock-up I designed really struggles to give the intended
        shape and the outlines just don’t do justice to the shape
        of the logo itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regardless, here’s the final design, with all of it’s
        slight imperfections:

        logo design with an additional outer-glow.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an extra side-note, I also designed the new vector with
        and without an outline. The older, original design has a
        default black glow with tons of manual tweaking in order
        to get the same general shape, but it’s really lazy
        looking and doesn’t portray the shape that it’s supposed
        to.
    </p>
    <p>
        …Alongside, of course, additional tweaks to the colour
        pallet that the logo is displayed as. Not to mention a
        different outline hue to contrast the new base purple a
        bit better.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regardless of my little quibbles of slight design
        imperfections, elements as simple as consistent line
        thickness and the 16,000 x 8,000 of glory is a much more
        glamorous result than the original concept piece. I’ll
        be soon to get around to swapping any current usage of
        my logo out with this. The vast increase in quality is
        such an eye-opener I couldn’t <i>not</i> do it.

        (And an additional benefit of getting around to
        vectoring and having a finalised product is the ability
        to convert it for other usages that work effectively
        individually!)
